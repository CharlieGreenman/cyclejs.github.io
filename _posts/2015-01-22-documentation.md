## Cycle *Core* [v1.0.0](https://github.com/cyclejs/cycle-core/releases/tag/v1.0.0) API: `Cycle` object

- [`run`](#run)
- [`Rx`](#Rx)

### <a id="run"></a> `run(app, drivers)`

Takes an `app` function and circularly connects it to the given collection
of driver functions.

The `app` function expects a collection of "driver response" Observables as
input, and should return a collection of "driver request" Observables.
A "collection of Observables" is a JavaScript object where
keys match the driver names registered by the `drivers` object, and values
are Observables or a collection of Observables.

#### Arguments:

- `app :: Function` a function that takes `responses` as input and outputs a collection of `requests` Observables.
- `drivers :: Object` an object where keys are driver names and values are driver functions.

#### Return:

*(Array)* an array where the first object is the collection of driver requests, and the second object is the collection of driver responses, that
can be used for debugging or testing.

### <a id="Rx"></a> `Rx`

A shortcut to the root object of
[RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS).

## Cycle *Web* [v1.0.0](https://github.com/cyclejs/cycle-web/releases/tag/v1.0.0) API: `CycleWeb` object

- [`makeDOMDriver`](#makeDOMDriver)
- [`makeHTMLDriver`](#makeHTMLDriver)
- [`h`](#h)
- [`svg`](#svg)

### <a id="makeDOMDriver"></a> `makeDOMDriver(container, customElements)`

A factory for the DOM driver function. Takes a `container` to define the
target on the existing DOM which this driver will operate on. All custom
elements which this driver can detect should be given as the second
parameter. The output of this driver is a collection of Observables queried
by a getter function: `domDriverOutput.get(selector, eventType)` returns an
Observable of events of `eventType` happening on the element determined by
`selector`. Also, `domDriverOutput.get(':root')` returns an Observable of
DOM element corresponding to the root (or container) of the app on the DOM.

#### Arguments:

- `container :: String|HTMLElement` the DOM selector for the element (or the element itself) to contain the rendering of the VTrees.
- `customElements :: Object` a collection of custom element definitions. The key of each property should be the tag name of the custom element, and
the value should be a function defining the implementation of the custom
element. This function follows the same contract as the top-most `app`
function: input are driver responses, output are requests to drivers.

#### Return:

*(Function)* the DOM driver function. The function expects an Observable of VTree as input, and outputs the response object for this
driver, containing functions `get()` and `dispose()` that can be used for
debugging and testing.

### <a id="makeHTMLDriver"></a> `makeHTMLDriver(customElements)`

A factory for the HTML driver function. Takes the registry object of all
custom elements as the only parameter. The HTML driver function will use
the custom element registry to detect custom element on the VTree and apply
their implementations.

#### Arguments:

- `customElements :: Object` a collection of custom element definitions. The key of each property should be the tag name of the custom element, and
the value should be a function defining the implementation of the custom
element. This function follows the same contract as the top-most `app`
function: input are driver responses, output are requests to drivers.

#### Return:

*(Function)* the HTML driver function. The function expects an Observable of Virtual DOM elements as input, and outputs an Observable of
strings as the HTML renderization of the virtual DOM elements.

### <a id="h"></a> `h`

A shortcut to [virtual-hyperscript](
https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom/tree/master/virtual-hyperscript).
This is a helper for creating VTrees in Views.

### <a id="svg"></a> `svg`

A shortcut to the svg hyperscript function.
