v0.23 introduces **Drivers**: a plugin-like API which allows you to build a conversation between your Cycle.js app and any side-effectful target or targets.

Previously, Cycle's abstraction was a circular interaction between the app and the user on the DOM. The core function `applyToDOM()` meant that all Cycle apps were tied to the DOM. Drivers generalize this idea and allow you to target not only the DOM, but any other interactive target, such as a server with WebSocket, iOS renderers, etc. 

Before, the `user()` function was embedded inside `applyToDOM()`. With drivers, you create the `user()` function and provide it to `Cycle.run()`. Compare these: 

**BEFORE**
{% highlight js %}
Cycle.applyToDOM('.js-container', appFn);
{% endhighlight %}

**AFTER**
{% highlight js %}
var userFn = Cycle.makeDOMDriver('.js-container');

Cycle.run(appFn, { DOM: userFn });
{% endhighlight %}

Cycle comes with `makeDOMDriver()`, a factory function which generates a "DOM user" function. `Cycle.run(appFn, drivers)` circularly connects appFn with a group of driver functions specified by `drivers` object.

The advantage of this is you can now externalize side effects from the app function. Potential drivers could be "XHR Driver", "WebSocket Driver", "Canvas Driver", etc. Each driver is just a function taking an Observable as input and producing an Observable as output (or a collection of Observables). 

This is last major API development before v1.0.

### Migration guide

Drivers imply some breaking change, but only with small boilerplate at some interfaces. This isn't as radical breaking change as, for instance, [v0.21](https://github.com/staltz/cycle/releases/tag/v0.21.0).

If your code is built with MVI architecture, this migration should only affect some boilerplate on Views and Intents. Models should stay intact.

The contract of your `appFn()` or `main()` has changed: it should take one single "queryable collection of Observables" as input and output one "collection of Observables".

**BEFORE**
{% highlight js %}
function computer(interactions) {
  return interactions.get(selector, type).flatMap( /* to vtree observable */ );
}
{% endhighlight %}

**AFTER**
{% highlight js %}
function main(drivers) {
  var vtree$ = drivers.get('DOM', selector, type).flatMap( /* to vtree observable */ );
  return {
    DOM: vtree$,
    driverFoo: // some observable...
    driverBar: // another observable...
  };
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `drivers` argument is a queryable collection of Observables. `drivers.get(driverName, ...params)` will get an Observable returned by the driver named `driverName`, given `...params`. Each driver can have its separate API for `...params`. For instance, for the DOM driver, the API is `drivers.get('DOM', selector, eventType)`.

The returned object should have Observables, and the keys should match the driver name. You give the driver name to the `run()` function:

{% highlight js %}
Cycle.run(main, {
  DOM: Cycle.makeDOMDriver('.js-container'),
  driverFoo: // a driver function for Foo
  driverBar: // a driver function for Bar
});
{% endhighlight %}

Migration steps:
1.  Replace `interactions.get(...params)` with `drivers.get('DOM', ...params)`
2.  Replace the return of the app function from `return vtree$` to `return {DOM: vtree$}`
3.  The dollar sign convention is no longer required by any Cycle.js feature. It is still recommended for applications, but not enforced by the framework, ever.
4.  `renderAsHTML()` became a driver of its own: `makeHTMLDriver()`. Use the HTML Driver like any other driver. See the isomorphic example for more details.

### Custom elements

Registering custom elements is not anymore a global mutation function. Instead, when building the DOM Driver function with `Cycle.makeDOMDriver()`, you provide an object where keys are the custom element tag names, and values are the definition functions for those custom elements.

**EXAMPLE**
{% highlight js %}
Cycle.run(app, {
  DOM: Cycle.makeDOMDriver('.js-container', {
    'my-element': myElementFn
  })
});
{% endhighlight %}

The definition function contract has changed slightly, but follows the same idea of the `main()` function contract: takes a queryable collection of Observables, and should output a collection (object) of Observables.

**BEFORE**

{% highlight js %}
function myComponent(interactions, props) {
  var destroy$ = interactions.get('.remove-btn', 'click');
  var id$ = props.get('itemid');
  // ...
  return {
    vtree$: vtree$,
    destroy$: destroy$,
    changeColor$: changeColor$,
    changeWidth$: changeWidth$
  };
}
{% endhighlight %}

**AFTER**
{% highlight js %}
function myComponent(drivers) {
  var destroy$ = drivers.get('DOM', '.remove-btn', 'click');
  var id$ = drivers.get('props', 'itemid');
  // ...
  return {
    DOM: vtree$,
    events: {
      destroy: destroy$,
      changeColor: changeColor$,
      changeWidth: changeWidth$
    }
  };
}
{% endhighlight %}


Migration steps:
1.  Replace function signature from `function (interaction, props)` to `function (drivers)`
2.  Replace `interactions.get(...params)` with `drivers.get('DOM', ...params)`
3.  Replace `props.get(...params)` with `drivers.get('props', ...params)`
4.  Replace the return of the definition function from `return {vtree$, myEvent$, ...}` to `return {DOM: vtree$, events: ...}`, where `events: ...` is an object where keys are the event name (**notice no more dollar sign `$` convention**!) and values are Observables.
